I wanted to look at the top 5 most visited places in the countries that have attracted most visitors globally. <br>
I scraped the data from the website : GoVisitY <br>
The data is arranged for top 30 countries with number of visitors and their top 5 most visited places. <br>
The idea is to help understand and grow the tourism industry <br>
There is not much data analytics on this project. However, this can be utilized by analysts to draw insights along with other financial data.
