A python program to extract data of different English premier league teams for seasons `2020` and `2021` The code will save the data in two csv files for each year. <br>
For now, I have uploaded the outputs of the code as different csv files. <br>
Please note that the code can be extended to extract data for other years. However, the users need to make sure of using the correct url. The season indices for each year are different and needs to be changed on the basis of the concerned year. <br>
The season indices for `2020` and `2021` are `363` and `418` respectively and are stored in the list `seasons`. <br>
The list `stat_types` contain the statistic that is to be extracted. The webpage contain much more stats about any player and the same can be extracted as required by the user. <br>
